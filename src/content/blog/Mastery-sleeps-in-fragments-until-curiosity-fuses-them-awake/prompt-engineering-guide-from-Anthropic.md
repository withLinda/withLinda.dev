## Getting Started with the Workbench

The Workbench provides an interactive environment where you can craft, test, and refine prompts without writing any code[^1]. Think of it as your laboratory for prompt engineering â€“ a place where you can experiment, iterate, and perfect your prompts before deploying them to production.

### Accessing the Workbench

1. Navigate to [https://console.anthropic.com/workbench](https://console.anthropic.com/workbench)
2. Sign in with your Anthropic account
3. You'll see a clean interface with areas for entering prompts and viewing responses

### Understanding the Interface

The Workbench interface consists of several key components:

- **Human Dialogue Box**: Where you enter your prompts
- **Assistant Response Area**: Displays Claude's output
- **Settings Panel**: Configure model, temperature, and token limits
- **Prompt Management**: Create, save, and organize your prompts
- **Evaluation Toggle**: Switch between single-run and evaluation modes

## Basic Workbench Usage

Let's start with the fundamentals of using the Workbench for prompt development[^1].

### Creating Your First Prompt

1. **Enter Your Prompt**: Type your prompt into the "Human" dialogue box
2. **Configure Settings**: Click the slider icon to adjust:
   - **Model Selection**: Choose between Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
   - **Temperature**: Control response randomness (0 for deterministic, 1 for creative)
   - **Max Tokens**: Set the maximum response length
3. **Run the Prompt**: Click "Run" to generate Claude's response

### Managing Prompts

The Workbench offers robust prompt management capabilities:

- **Create New Prompts**: Click the "+" icon in the upper left
- **View Prompt History**: Click the bulleted list icon to see previous prompts
- **Save Prompts**: Store successful prompts for future use
- **Organize by Project**: Group related prompts together

### Example: Basic Customer Support Prompt

```
Human: You are a helpful customer support agent. A customer writes: "My order hasn't arrived yet and it's been 5 days." 

Please provide a professional and empathetic response.
```

This basic prompt works, but the Workbench allows you to create much more sophisticated prompts with variables and structured templates.

## Working with Variables and Templates

One of the Workbench's most powerful features is its support for dynamic variables, allowing you to create reusable prompt templates[^2].

### Creating Variable-Based Prompts

Variables in the Workbench use double curly braces: `{{variable_name}}`. This enables you to:

- Test the same prompt with different inputs
- Create flexible, reusable templates
- Build comprehensive evaluation suites

### Example: Advanced Code Review Template

```
Human: You are an expert {{SOURCE_LANGUAGE}} code reviewer. Please review the following code and provide feedback on:
1. Code quality and best practices
2. Potential bugs or issues
3. Performance considerations
4. Security concerns

Code to review:
{{SOURCE_CODE}}

Please structure your response using these sections:
<summary>Brief overview of the code</summary>
<issues>Critical issues that must be fixed</issues>
<suggestions>Improvements and optimizations</suggestions>
<security>Any security considerations</security>
```

### Setting Variable Values

1. Click on the variables (`{ }`) button in the Workbench
2. Enter test values for each variable
3. Run the prompt with different variable combinations
4. Save successful variable sets for future use

### Variable Best Practices

- **Use Descriptive Names**: `{{CUSTOMER_MESSAGE}}` is better than `{{MSG}}`
- **Set Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults for quick testing
- **Document Variables**: Include descriptions of expected input formats
- **Test Edge Cases**: Try empty values, very long inputs, and special characters

## The Prompt Improver: Your AI Assistant

The Workbench includes a revolutionary prompt improver that automatically enhances your prompts using a sophisticated 4-step process[^3].

### The 4-Step Improvement Process

#### Step 1: Example Identification
The improver first locates and extracts any examples from your existing prompt template. This helps preserve your specific use cases while restructuring the prompt for better performance.

#### Step 2: Initial Draft Creation
Next, it creates a structured template with:
- Clear section divisions using XML tags
- Explicit role definitions
- Organized instructions
- Formatted output requirements

#### Step 3: Chain of Thought Refinement
The improver adds detailed reasoning instructions that guide Claude through systematic analysis:
- Breaking down complex tasks into steps
- Requiring explicit reasoning before conclusions
- Adding validation checkpoints
- Ensuring comprehensive coverage

#### Step 4: Example Enhancement
Finally, it updates your examples to demonstrate the new reasoning process, showing Claude exactly how to apply the chain-of-thought approach.

### Transformation Example

**Original Prompt:**
```
From the following list of Wikipedia article titles, identify which article this sentence came from. Respond with just the article title and nothing else.

Articles: {{ARTICLES}}
Sentence: {{SENTENCE}}
```

**Improved Prompt:**
```
You are an intelligent text classification system. Your task is to identify which Wikipedia article a given sentence came from.

<instructions>
Analyze the provided sentence and article list carefully:
1. Read through each article title
2. Consider the subject matter and likely content of each article
3. Identify key terms and context clues in the sentence
4. Match the sentence to the most likely article based on topical relevance
</instructions>

<articles>
{{ARTICLES}}
</articles>

<sentence>
{{SENTENCE}}
</sentence>

<analysis>
Think through this step-by-step:
- What is the main topic of the sentence?
- Which article titles relate to this topic?
- What specific details in the sentence point to a particular article?
</analysis>

Based on your analysis, the sentence comes from: [Article Title]
```

### When to Use the Prompt Improver

The prompt improver excels when you need:
- **Systematic Reasoning**: Tasks requiring step-by-step analysis
- **Consistent Output**: Standardized response formats
- **Higher Accuracy**: Complex tasks where accuracy is paramount
- **Detailed Explanations**: When you need Claude to show its work

However, be aware that improved prompts may:
- Generate longer responses
- Increase processing time
- Use more tokens
- Be overkill for simple tasks

## Evaluation Mode: Testing at Scale

The Evaluation mode transforms the Workbench into a comprehensive testing platform, allowing you to validate prompts across multiple scenarios[^4].

### Switching to Evaluation Mode

1. Click the "Evaluate" toggle button at the top of the Workbench
2. The interface changes to a spreadsheet-like view
3. Each row represents a test case
4. Columns contain input variables and outputs

### Creating Test Cases

You have three methods to build your test suite:

#### Method 1: Manual Creation
- Click "Add Row" to create a new test case
- Enter values for each variable manually
- Ideal for specific edge cases or known problematic inputs

#### Method 2: Automatic Generation
- Click "Generate Test Case" to have Claude Opus create test cases
- Claude analyzes your prompt and generates relevant test scenarios
- Customize generation logic by clicking the arrow dropdown
- Edit the generation prompt to focus on specific types of test cases

#### Method 3: CSV Import
- Prepare test cases in a spreadsheet
- Export as CSV file
- Import directly into the Workbench
- Perfect for large-scale testing or migrating existing test suites

### Running Evaluations

Once your test cases are ready:

1. **Individual Testing**: Click "Run" next to specific test cases
2. **Batch Testing**: Click "Run Remaining" to execute all pending tests
3. **Re-run Suite**: Test prompt modifications against your entire suite
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch as results populate in real-time

### The Ideal Output Column

The Workbench includes an optional "ideal output" column that serves as your benchmark[^5]:

- Define expected outputs for each test case
- Compare actual results against ideal responses
- Quickly identify deviations and improvements
- Use for regression testing when modifying prompts

## Advanced Evaluation Techniques

### Comparative Analysis

The Workbench's comparison feature allows you to test multiple prompt versions simultaneously:

1. Click "+ Add Comparison" button
2. Enter alternative prompt versions
3. Run the same test cases against all versions
4. View results side-by-side
5. Identify which version performs best

### Quality Grading System

Implement a 5-point grading scale for subjective evaluation:

- **5 - Excellent**: Exceeds expectations, perfect response
- **4 - Good**: Meets requirements with minor improvements possible
- **3 - Acceptable**: Adequate but needs refinement
- **2 - Poor**: Significant issues, major revisions needed
- **1 - Failure**: Does not meet basic requirements

### Subject Matter Expert Review

For domain-specific prompts:

1. Generate outputs for your test cases
2. Share results with subject matter experts
3. Have experts grade responses using the 5-point scale
4. Aggregate scores to identify prompt strengths and weaknesses
5. Iterate based on expert feedback

### Test Case Design Principles

Create effective test suites by following these principles[^6]:

#### Coverage
- **Happy Path**: Standard, expected inputs
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and limits
- **Error Cases**: Invalid or problematic inputs
- **Real-World Data**: Actual examples from production
- **Adversarial Inputs**: Attempts to break the prompt

#### Diversity
- Vary input lengths (very short to maximum allowed)
- Include different languages and character sets
- Test various formatting styles
- Mix formal and informal language
- Include ambiguous cases

#### Measurability
- Define clear success criteria
- Use quantifiable metrics when possible
- Establish baseline performance
- Track improvements over iterations

   - Python (using anthropic library)
   - TypeScript/JavaScript (using @anthropic-ai/sdk)
   - cURL commands for direct API calls
3. Copy the generated code
4. Integrate into your application

### Example: Python Implementation

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(
    api_key="your-api-key-here"
)

def process_customer_message(customer_message):
    message = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
        max_tokens=1000,
        temperature=0.7,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"""You are a helpful customer support agent. 
                
A customer writes: "{customer_message}"

Please provide a professional and empathetic response."""
            }
        ]
    )
    return message.content

# Usage
response = process_customer_message("My order hasn't arrived yet and it's been 5 days.")
print(response)
```

### Example: TypeScript Implementation

```typescript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
});

async function processCustomerMessage(customerMessage: string): Promise<string> {
  const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
    max_tokens: 1000,
    temperature: 0.7,
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: `You are a helpful customer support agent.
        
A customer writes: "${customerMessage}"

Please provide a professional and empathetic response.`
      }
    ]
  });
  
  return message.content[0].text;
}

// Usage
const response = await processCustomerMessage("My order hasn't arrived yet and it's been 5 days.");
console.log(response);
```

## What: The Problem

### Symptoms
- Website loads perfectly in incognito/private mode
- Same website fails in regular browser with errors like:
  - `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN`
  - `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`
  - `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`
  - Site stuck loading or showing old version
  - HTTPS security warnings that can't be bypassed
  - "This site can't be reached" errors

### When This Commonly Occurs
- After DNS changes or domain migrations
- During development with localhost
- After SSL/TLS certificate updates
- When switching between HTTP and HTTPS
- After deploying to new hosting providers (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

---

## Why: Root Causes

### 1. DNS Cache (Most Common for Domain Changes)

**Browser DNS Cache**
- Browsers maintain their own DNS cache separate from system cache
- Incognito Mode ignores DNS cache, fetching fresh data each time
- Failed DNS lookups are cached, causing persistent NXDOMAIN errors

**System DNS Cache**
- Operating system caches DNS at system level
- Affects all browsers except incognito mode
- Can persist even after browser restarts

### 2. Browser Cache & Cookies

**HTTP Cache**
- Incognito Mode ignores cached data, so it loads a fresh version of the site — like hitting a reset button
- Cached redirects (301/302) can cause loops
- Old cached resources may conflict with new deployments

**Cookies & Session Storage**
- Cookies store login info, preferences, and session data. But when these cookies get expired, broken, or just plain weird, a website might refuse to load properly
- Corrupted cookies can break authentication
- Session conflicts between old and new versions

### 3. HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

**What HSTS Does**
- The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) informs browsers that the host should only be accessed using HTTPS
- Browser remembers to use HTTPS for specific duration
- Cannot be bypassed with "proceed anyway" option

**Why It Causes Issues**
- Previous HTTPS visit cached HSTS settings
- Certificate changes or misconfigurations trigger errors
- Unlike other HTTPS errors, HSTS-related errors cannot be bypassed

### 4. Browser Extensions

- Since most browsers disable extensions in Incognito Mode, the website suddenly works fine
- Common problematic extensions:
  - Ad blockers
  - Privacy extensions
  - CORS/security modifiers
  - Developer tools
  - VPNs/proxy extensions

### 5. Service Workers & PWA Cache

- Service workers persist in regular browsing
- Can serve outdated cached content
- Not active in incognito mode
- Can interfere with new deployments

## How: Solutions

### Quick Fix Methods (Try First)

#### 1. Force Hard Refresh
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

#### 2. Clear Chrome DNS Cache
```
chrome://net-internals/#dns
→ Click "Clear host cache"

chrome://net-internals/#sockets  
→ Click "Flush socket pools"
```

#### 3. Clear System DNS Cache

**Windows:**
```cmd
ipconfig /flushdns
```

**macOS:**
```bash
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
# or
sudo service nscd restart
```

### Comprehensive Solutions

#### Method 1: Clear All Browser Data (Nuclear Option)

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear browsing data
2. Time range: "All time"
3. Select ALL:
   - Browsing history
   - Cookies and other site data
   - Cached images and files
   - Site settings
   - Hosted app data
4. Clear data and restart browser

**Firefox:**
1. Settings → Privacy & Security → Clear Data
2. Or: `Ctrl + Shift + Del`
3. Select "Everything" for time range
4. Check all boxes
5. Clear and restart

#### Method 2: Clear HSTS Settings

**Chrome/Chromium:**
```
chrome://net-internals/#hsts
→ Enter domain in "Query HSTS/PKP domain"
→ Enter domain in "Delete domain security policies"  
→ Click Delete
```

**Firefox:**
1. History (`Ctrl + Shift + H`)
2. Find the website
3. Right-click → "Forget About This Site"

Or manually:
1. Navigate to `about:support`
2. Open Profile Folder
3. Close Firefox
4. Edit `SiteSecurityServiceState.txt`
5. Remove domain entry

**Edge:**
```
edge://net-internals/#hsts
→ Same as Chrome process
```

#### Method 3: Clear Site-Specific Data

**Chrome (Recommended for development):**
1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Application tab
3. Storage → Clear site data

**Alternative:**
1. Click padlock icon in address bar
2. Site settings
3. Clear data

#### Method 4: Service Worker Cleanup

**Chrome DevTools:**
1. Application tab → Service Workers
2. Check "Update on reload"
3. Click "Unregister" for all workers
4. Clear storage

**Or via Chrome settings:**
```
chrome://settings/content/all
→ Find your site
→ Delete all data
```

#### Method 5: Extension Troubleshooting

1. Disable all extensions: `chrome://extensions`
2. Test the site
3. If it works, enable extensions one by one
4. Identify and remove/configure problematic extension

### Development-Specific Solutions

#### For Localhost Issues:
```
# Clear Chrome localhost HSTS
chrome://net-internals/#hsts
→ Delete: localhost
→ Delete: 127.0.0.1
```

#### For New Deployments:
1. Clear all site data in DevTools
2. Unregister service workers
3. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
4. Test in new incognito window first

## Prevention & Best Practices

### For Developers

#### 1. DNS Change Strategy
- **Before changing DNS:**
  - Lower TTL values 24-48 hours in advance
  - Document old DNS settings
  - Prepare rollback plan

- **During DNS change:**
  - Keep both old and new servers running
  - Use 302 (temporary) redirects initially
  - Monitor both servers

- **After DNS change:**
  - Wait for propagation (up to 48 hours)
  - Test from multiple locations/devices
  - Switch to 301 redirects only after verification

#### 2. HSTS Implementation
```http
# Start with short max-age for testing
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=300

# Gradually increase after verification
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

#### 3. Service Worker Versioning
```javascript
// Add version to service worker
const CACHE_VERSION = 'v1.2.3';

// Implement proper cache busting
self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.keys().then(cacheNames => {
      return Promise.all(
        cacheNames
          .filter(name => name !== CACHE_VERSION)
          .map(name => caches.delete(name))
      );
    })
  );
});
```

#### 4. Development Headers
```javascript
// Prevent aggressive caching during development
response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate');
response.headers.set('Pragma', 'no-cache');
response.headers.set('Expires', '0');
```

### For Users/Testers

#### Regular Maintenance
- Clear browser cache monthly
- Update browser regularly
- Review and clean extensions periodically

#### Testing New Deployments
1. Always test in incognito first
2. Clear site data before testing updates
3. Document which browser/version you're using
4. Check from multiple networks if possible

## Key Takeaways

1. **Incognito works because it bypasses**: DNS cache, browser cache, cookies, HSTS settings, extensions, and service workers

2. **Most common cause for domain changes**: DNS cache at browser level, not system level

3. **Fastest universal fix**: Clear site-specific data in DevTools → Application → Clear storage

4. **Prevention is key**: Implement proper cache headers, version service workers, and use gradual HSTS rollout

5. **Not a bug, it's a feature**: These caches exist to improve performance and security—they just need proper management during changes

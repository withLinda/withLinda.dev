# About Me

Hello! I'm Linda, a freelance developer on Upwork and an AI specialist based in Indonesia. I've spent 10 years working on complex projects through Upwork, including maintaining a Semantic Knowledge Base, building my expertise in data structuring and AI integration. Currently, I'm developing ContextDistiller, a SaaS that intelligently consolidates redundant information using semantic analysis.
I approach coding challenges like puzzles - each piece revealing the next in sequence. My work combines technical precision with creative problem-solving.

## What I Do

I specialize in creating solutions that bridge AI and web technologies:
Frontend & Applications

- React, TypeScript, Astro
- Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive design
- AI integration and prompt engineering

Automation & Data

- Web scraping at scale (Playwright, Puppeteer, Scrapy)
- LLM fine-tuning and optimization 
- Knowledge base management 
- Python-based automation pipelines

When I'm not coding, you'll find me in Fallout 76, exploring ideas, or being supervised by my two cats.

# How to Delete node_modules and Run a Clean App

To start from scratch by removing the node_modules directory and running a clean app, follow these steps:

## Delete node_modules

From your terminal, navigate to your project root directory and run:

```bash
# Remove node_modules directory
rm -rf node_modules
```

## Clean npm cache (optional but recommended)

```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force
```

## Reinstall dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies from package.json
npm install
```

## Run the app

After reinstalling dependencies, you can run your app:

```bash
# Start the app
npm start
```

Or if you're in development mode:

```bash
# Run in development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

This process ensures you have a clean installation of all dependencies, which can help resolve issues caused by corrupted or outdated packages.

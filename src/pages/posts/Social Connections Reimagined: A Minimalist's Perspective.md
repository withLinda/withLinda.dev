# Social Connections Reimagined: A Minimalist's Perspective

What is minimalism about? It's about needing fewer things to be happy. When we need less, we spend less money and have more time and energy. So here's a question: Can we use this same idea with friendships? Can we be happy with very few friends, or even none at all?

A social minimalist tries to have just enough friends to meet their basic social needs - no more. Many people think this is unhealthy and causes pain. They say having no friends means missing out on what groups of friends can offer. But is being friendless really as bad as people think? Should we feel sorry for people without friends?

Most people believe having friends is always better than having none. We often celebrate friendship as something wonderful. Having many friends means we have many chances to spend time with others and enjoy being around people. But the social minimalist sees benefits in having fewer friends. Sometimes, having no friends might even be the best choice.

So, can we be happy without friends? We'll look at what's good and bad about friendship, how friendship works today, and whether we truly need friends.

## The Decline of Friendship

Epicurus, an ancient Greek thinker, had an idea about happiness. He thought we could find peace by carefully managing what we want and seeking moderate pleasures. He sorted our needs into three groups: things we naturally need, things we want but don't need, and empty desires. He thought things like extreme wealth and fame were pointless because we can never get enough of them. He also believed that fancy food, marriage, and sex were natural but not necessary for happiness. But friendship? He ranked it as important as food and shelter, saying it was one of the best ways to find happiness and usually easy to get.

He wrote:

> "Of all the means which wisdom acquires to ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most important is friendship."

Unlike romantic love, friendship (also called 'philia') usually doesn't create intense emotions. There's less possessiveness and jealousy, and it's more relaxed. Friendship is mainly about sharing interests, being useful to each other, and enjoying time together.

Epicurus said friendship works when people trust each other, treat each other well, and stay generous. When these things happen, friends help us learn about the world, share ideas, and learn from each other's experiences. They can help us when we need it, listen to our problems, and give advice in tough times. Being part of a friend group can also create opportunities, like meeting potential partners. Epicurus chose to live with his friends, enjoying simple pleasures like bread, cheese, and light wine.

Looking at Epicurus's ideas today, we can see friendship still offers these benefits. We now have even more ways to be friends - we can have friends anywhere in the world, make friends online, and talk to them whenever we want. But modern communication and society have changed how traditional friendship works. Many things we used to need friends for, we can now get elsewhere. We can pay for counseling instead of talking to friends about problems, or hire movers instead of asking friends for help. We don't need to leave home to have discussions anymore - there are plenty of online groups and forums.

The internet makes it easier to find people who think like us than meeting them in person because we're not limited to people nearby. Online dating, which was rare in the early 2000s, is now normal - so we don't need to go to social events to find partners anymore.

We can find quick, cheap entertainment through streaming and video games, which many people now prefer over meeting friends. So it seems friendship isn't as necessary as before, mainly because technology offers so many alternatives. The metaverse will probably speed up this change, as more people spend time in virtual reality.

Some people find the idea of a world without friends scary. But traditional friendship has its downsides and costs too.

## The Cost of Friendship

Having friends isn't free. In today's world, where we focus more on ourselves, traditional friendship is harder to maintain than in Epicurus's time. Our busy lives take up most of our time and energy.

Friends can be wonderful, but we don't need them to survive anymore. As C.S. Lewis put it:

> "Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself (for God did not need to create). It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival."

For many people today, having lots of friends is like a luxury item. It's harder to find and keep friends now, and it comes with costs that not everyone wants to pay.

The first cost is time. Many of us have very little free time. Do we want to spend that limited time with other people? Many choose not to, preferring to spend time alone on creative activities.

The second cost is energy. After work, many people are too tired to socialize and prefer watching TV. This means we often save socializing for weekends, using what little energy we have left after the work week. Many people choose to spend this time alone to recover their energy instead.

The third cost is money. Being social often means spending money. Having no social life saves money. Also, people with little money might not be able to afford social activities, which can lead to being isolated.

The fourth cost is less obvious but still real: the need to fit in. Friendships require us to conform somewhat to what others expect. Whether we realize it or not, we want our friends to like us, and they want us to like them.

So we hide parts of ourselves to please them, covering up traits they might not like. As Arthur Schopenhauer said:

> "We can only truly be ourselves when alone, where we don't have to wear these masks."

## The Misery of Bad Friends

Not all friendships live up to Epicurus's ideals. Some friendships can actually make us unhappy, especially when people don't care about what's best for us.

The Buddha warned against spending time with foolish people and encouraged friendship with wise people instead. Being around bad friends can hurt us and keep us from meeting wise people who could improve our lives. The Buddha taught that if you can't find wise friends, it's better to be alone. An early Buddhist text called the "Rhino Sutra" suggests we should "wander alone like rhinoceros."

The text says:

> "Avoid the evil companion disregarding the goal, intent on the out-of-tune way. Don't take as a friend someone heedless and hankering. Wander alone like a rhinoceros."

Many people have friends just to have friends, without any standards for who they let into their lives. This leads them to spend time with harmful people. For example, some people keep up dangerous habits like violence or drugs to fit in with a group. Others accept hateful ideas to stay connected with friends. Some put up with bullying that goes beyond friendly joking, just because they're afraid of being alone. Or they waste time in pointless conversations when they could be doing better things.

People often talk about 'toxic friends' these days. Even when we know these people are bad for us, we might keep them around because we're scared of being alone. Many people seem to prefer bad relationships over being by themselves, probably because being alone frightens them.

For many generations, we needed groups to survive, and being kicked out of the group often meant death. We had to accept the problems that came with living in groups. But today, in many societies, we can survive with very little social contact. This means we have the choice to avoid people who make us unhappy.

As Robin Williams once said:

> "I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone."

## Do We Need Friendship?

Is there a good reason to be a social minimalist? Or do we really need friends to meet our social needs? Dr. Daniel Marson, a psychologist and author, says humans don't need friends. He agrees that talking with others is important for human development. But he thinks we put too much importance on how deep these relationships need to be.

Marson says:

> "We need to interact with each other but it is not necessary that these relationships reach anything more than a basic level of connectedness. It is nice to have strong social relationships but it is not necessary for our survival or even our happiness. Simply put, it is not necessary for humans to have friends."

He explains that many people have trouble making and keeping friends, and they often feel bad about themselves because of this. The real problem isn't just not having friends - it's thinking there's something wrong with not having friends. According to Marson, it's perfectly fine not to have friends. Having no friends doesn't automatically mean you're lonely or isolated - there's a difference between being socially isolated and not having close friends. We can get the same benefits of friendship just by having the chance to interact with people. This suggests that having minimal social connections might be enough to meet our social needs.

While we think friendship is important, a study of about 4,000 adults found that having our basic needs met and feeling good at what we do matters more. If we compare this to Epicurus's hierarchy of needs, we can see that meeting our basic, natural needs is most important for being happy. This is different from what Epicurus believed about friendship being essential.

However, interacting with others is still an important part of human life that benefits us. We should emphasize how important social interactions are, especially when circumstances force us to have fewer of them. Also, in our increasingly individual-focused cultures, many people lack social interaction even when they have friends.

Not having traditional friendships doesn't seem to be a big problem. When we think about the costs and downsides of having friends, sometimes being friendless might even be better. But cutting off all social interaction probably isn't good for most of us. We naturally want to connect with others. It helps our mental well-being. Even a friendly chat with a store cashier can make a difference.
